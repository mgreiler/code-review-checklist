- [ ] Is the right encryption used?
- [ ] Does this code change reveal any secret
information like keys, passwords, or usernames?
- [ ] Is data retrieved from external APIs or libraries
checked for security issues?

## Performance

system performance?
- [ ] Do you see any potential to improve the
performance of the code significantly?


## Usability and Accessibility
- [ ] Is the proposed solution well-designed from a
usability perspective?
- [ ] Is the API well documented?
- [ ] Is the proposed solution (UI) accessible?
- [ ] Is the API/UI intuitive to use?

## Ethics and Morality
- [ ] Does this change make use of user data in a way that 
might raise privacy concerns?
- [ ] Does the change exploit behavioral patterns or human
weaknesses? 
- [ ] Might the code, or what it enables, lead to mental 
and physical harm for (some) users?
- [ ] If the code adds or alters ways in which people 
interact with each other, are appropriate measures
in place to prevent/limit/report harassment or abuse?
- [ ] Does this change lead to an exclusion of a certain
group of people or users?
- [ ] Does this code change introduce unjust impact on people, 
particularly those related to sensitive characteristics such as
race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, income, sexual orientation, ability, 
and political or religious belief?
- [ ] Does this code change introduce any algorithm, 
AI  or machine learning bias?


## Testing and Testability
- [ ] Is the code testable?
- [ ] Have automated tests been added, or have related ones been updated to cover the change?
- [ ] Do the existing tests reasonably cover the code change (unit/integration/system tests)? 
- [ ] Are there some test cases, input or edge cases
that should be tested in addition?

## Readability
- [ ] Is the code easy to understand?
- [ ] Which parts were confusing to you and why?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by
smaller methods?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by
different function, method or variable names?
- [ ] Is the code located in the right
file/folder/package?
- [ ] Do you think certain methods should be
restructured to have a more intuitive control
flow?
- [ ] Is the data flow understandable?
- [ ] Are there redundant or outdated comments?
- [ ] Could some comments convey the message
better?
- [ ] Would more comments make the code more
understandable?
- [ ] Could some comments be removed by making the code itself more readable?
- [ ] Is there any commented-out code?

## Experts' Opinion
- [ ] Do you think a specific expert, like a security
expert or a usability expert, should look over
the code before it can be accepted?
- [ ] Will this code change impact different teams, and should they review the change as well?
